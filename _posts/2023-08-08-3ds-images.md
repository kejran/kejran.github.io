This is part six of the [Nintendo 3DS Homebrew series.]({% post_url 2022-08-12-3ds-intro %})

This post elaborates on the previous part - we will load images and display them as 2d sprites. You can use the code from the previous section. [See the first entry, which introduces the application structure and initialization code.]({% post_url 2023-08-07-3ds-2d-rendering %})

[This post uses assets from Kenney's 1-bit pack, which is the best tileset ever.](https://kenney.nl/assets/1-bit-pack)

# Building an image

First, we will need a sample image to use. I will use this 16x16 sprite:

![the dude](/assets/2d/dude.png){:.sprite}

*All sprites on this page are upscaled in the browser, you can download and use them directly.*

## Compression

Create a `gfx` folder in the main folder of your project and place the image inside. 

By default, images are compiled according to the recipes found in `.t3s` files. Create a companion `*.t3s` file (which can have a different name from the image) for the image, and specify compression options. 

For example, for my image `dude.png`, I want a 16-bit RGBA5551 pixel format, auto compression, and a single file:
```
-f rgba5551 -z auto
dude.png
```

This file is just a list of arguments to the `tex3ds` tool, that the build will use for compiling the file. 

For compression, you probably want to always use `auto`. It will automatically select the method to get the best filesize. For pixel format, it depends: 

* For most sprites, `rgb565` for opaque / `rgba5551` for alpha images will do. Lossy, quantizes colors, binary alpha.

* If you have memory to spare or need better alpha or gradients, use `rgb8` / `rgba8`. Lossless.

* Larger images could use `etc1` / `etc1a4`. Lossy, block-based, and best for textures. Avoid for UI or pixelart.

Once you made your selection and created the file, it is ready for compilation. It will happen as a part of build process, but we will need to enable it first. In the Makefile, enable the build step and point the output to the build folder:
```
GFXBUILD	:=	$(BUILD)
```
This will write the files into the build directory and generate object and header files to directly include in the codebase. 

# Importing the image

Now that the file is built, you can include it as a regular header. For example, given our `dude.t3s` file, we can import a header:

```cpp
#include "dude_t3x.h"
```
Which will expose the `dude_t3x` and `dude_t3x_size` defines - which, obviously, contain hardcoded file payload and length. 

The files should automatically convert before compiling the code, so it should always just work - but if including fails, run the compile step once before adding the include, so it can generate the files. It will also prevent code completion from complaining.

Now we are ready to load the image, and there are to ways we can go around doing it.

## citro2d spritesheet

`citro2d` has functionality for loading multiple images in an atlas - loading a single image is just an edge case of loading an atlas fully filled with a single image.

You can load a spritesheet (that in our case consists of a single image) like so:
```cpp
auto sheet = C2D_SpriteSheetLoadFromMem(dude_t3x, dude_t3x_size);
```

Then, to retrieve a handle to the first image:
```cpp
u32 atlas_index = 0;
auto img2d = C2D_SpriteSheetGetImage(sheet, atlas_index);
```

And after you are done using the images, release the spritesheet:
```cpp
C2D_SpriteSheetFree(sheet);
```
This will clean up vram and metadata for this image set.

## citro3d way

Alternatively, the spritesheet functionality simply wraps the base 3d texture loading for no practical benefit, we might as well just skip it<sup>1</sup> - and you can use the same code for handling 3d textures in the future.

The data can be fed into the base image loading function:

```cpp
C3D_Tex texture;
auto meta = Tex3DS_TextureImport(
    dude_t3x, // payload
    dude_t3x_size, // size
    &texture, // destination for 2d textures
    nullptr, // destination for reflection maps
    true // send it to the gpu instead of regular memory
);	
```
The loader also returns a handle to `Tex3DS_Texture` which contains metadata about the loaded image (for example, sub-regions when building an image atlas). Either keep it around or discard like so:
```cpp
Tex3DS_TextureFree(meta);
```
I suggest you keep it until you remove the texture itself - alternatively, if you know size of the images, you can create it yourself on demand.

Now the image is loaded and the `C3D_Tex` handle points to it, we can use it for rendering. To get the `C2D_Image` handle, wrap the texture along with subtexture info:
```cpp
u32 atlas_index = 0;
C2D_Image img2d { &texture, Tex3DS_GetSubTexture(meta, atlas_index) };
```
And then use it for rendering. After you are done, release the texture data:
```cpp
C3D_TexDelete(&texture);
```

<sup>1</sup><sub>I actually used it like so before i found the spritesheet functionality - during writing this tutorial...</sub>

# Drawing the image

Once you have a `C2D_Image` handle, you can pass it to any of the drawing functions, for example:
```cpp 
C2D_DrawImageAt(
    img2d, 
    160, // x position
    80, // y position,
    1, // depth in 3d mode
    nullptr, // optional tint
    5, // x scale
    5, // y scale
);
```
Now, if we put this function in our rendering loop, replacing the wondrous white rectangle (bye), we will hopefully get something more interesting:

![First sprite](/assets/screens/2d_dude.png)

Pops right at you.

Anyway, we got the basic image on the screen. In a full application you will probably want to do something more involved. For example, you can use different functions:
* `C2D_DrawImageAtRotated` to draw images at an angle,
* `C2D_DrawImage`, which takes `C2D_DrawParams` that allows for even more flexibility - such as setting rotation origin.

There also exists `C2D_Sprite` related functionality, but I found that to be... not very useful, personally I think it is much better to compute sprite state based on your game logic on demand during rendering. But YMMV. You can check examples to see how to use it.  

Also, if you want to smoothly move sprites and rotate them, you might want to switch from nearest neighbor interpolation to linear:
```cpp
c3dtex.param |= 
    GPU_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER(GPU_LINEAR) |
    GPU_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER(GPU_LINEAR);
``` 
If you use c2d spritesheet, you will need to extract the `C3D_Tex` reference from `C2D_Image`. This applies to the entire texture atlas at once.

## Spritesheet
Lastly, we can use multiple images in an atlas to draw a bigger variety of images. I will add three more images to my `gfx` folder:

|![grass 1](/assets/2d/grass1.png){:.sprite} | ![grass 2](/assets/2d/grass2.png){:.sprite} | ![tree](/assets/2d/tree.png){:.sprite} | 

And modify the `.t3s` file to include them and enable image atlas:
```
-f rgba5551 -z auto --atlas
dude.png
grass1.png
grass2.png
tree.png
```

As an example, lets draw a simple 2d tilemap. 3ds' 400x240 screen divides nicely into 25x15 16 pixel tiles. 
A simple tile drawing function could look like this:
```cpp
void drawTile(C2D_SpriteSheet sheet, int sprite, int x, int y) {
	auto img = C2D_SpriteSheetGetImage(sheet, sprite);
	C2D_DrawImageAt(img, x * 16, y * 16, 1);
}
```
Then, a simple usage would be like this - I will just reseed a random generator<sup>2</sup> to keep it short.
```cpp
C2D_TargetClear(top, 0xff'39'29'42);

srand(0);

for (int y = 0; y < 15; ++y)
    for (int x = 0; x < 25; ++x) {        

        int sprite = (rand() & 1) + 1;
        drawTile(sheet, sprite, x, y);
    }
```
In a real game, this would be handcrafted or calculated from fractal noise.

Then, I will just randomly place our character and a few trees... 
```cpp
drawTile(sheet, 0, 12, 7);
drawTile(sheet, 3, 7, 3);
drawTile(sheet, 3, 10, 11);
drawTile(sheet, 3, 22, 9);
```
Again, in a real game, this will be called from your entity draw code during ecs/scenegraph walk, particle system, et cetera.

<sup>2</sup><sub>Yes, I am aware that `rand` barely deserves being called a random generator. But it sure is simple to use.</sub>

## Results and going further

Now, after compiling it, we can run our game in emulator again and see our... art installation, I guess?

Feel free to play around and expand. Maybe add scrolling, moving entities, expand the tilesheet, or just ignore grid rendering and make an Asteroids clone with freely rotating sprites.

Getting 2d images on screen where you want can get you pretty far on its own. Throw in time management and input handling, and you can create complete games. And thus, this will be what the next entry will focus on.
