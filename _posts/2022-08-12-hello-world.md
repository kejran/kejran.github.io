I have decided to create a new blog, documenting some of my escapades into the world of programming. 

I expect to use this space to ocassionally note down things of interest that I discovered - or falied to find on the wide sea of the net, and had to infer myself. Hopefully this will be of some use to somebody.

I plan to start with a primer to Nintendo 3DS homebrew development, and will possibly add few posts regarding general 3d graphics.
